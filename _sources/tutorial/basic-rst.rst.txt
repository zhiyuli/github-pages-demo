Intro to RST
============

Sphinx can use markdown and ReSTructured Text. We will focus on ReSTructured text for now.

#. **Basic RST Syntax**


   Take a moment to go over these RST Resources:

   
   * `Quick reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_
   * `Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx CheatSheet <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_


#. **RST Hyperlink**

   There are `a variety of ways to link and reference in RST <https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html>`_, but we will just quickly review making basic external links.

   The syntax for an external link is:

   .. code-block::

    `My Text <https://www.google.com/>`


   The above link looks like this: `My Text <https://www.google.com/>`_ Try adding a link to your index.rst page.


#. **Brief Intro to TOC**

   When you open ``docs/index.rst`` you will see::

        .. toctree::
            :maxdepth: 2
            :caption: Contents:

   This is a toc (table of contents) tree directive. It links to other pages and defines the tree of pages within your site. `See the Sphinx "Directives" page for more info <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html>`_ 


#. **Adding a Page**

   Now, we will use the toctree to add a page. Within the ``docs/`` folder, create a file called "test.rst". Give it a title by copy/pasting::

        Test
        ====
    
   Into it and then run ``make html``. What happens?

   .. raw:: html

        <details>
            <summary>Click after you've run make html</summary>
            <p>You should see a red warning stating "WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree".</p>
        </details>

   To fix the issue, you add "test" (or the name of your file without the extension) to the toctree in index.rst. So your index.rst should look like::

        .. mycybergis documentation master file, created by
        sphinx-quickstart on Thu Jun  2 21:31:49 2022.
        You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
        contain the root `toctree` directive.

        Welcome to mycybergis's documentation!
        ======================================

        .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2
        :caption: Contents:
        
        test



        Indices and tables
        ==================

        * :ref:`genindex`
        * :ref:`modindex`
        * :ref:`search`

   Now, run ``make html`` again, you should see "Test" in your contents. You may notice the sidebar change when click the Test page. Sometimes when you change the toctree, you need to wipe everything (``make clean``) and rebuild (``make html``) to fix the toctree/sidebar.


#. **Adding a Video**

  Let's embed a video! You can do this by adding raw HTML to RST! In our test.rst page, let's add::

        .. raw:: html

            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The output above allows us to put raw HTML into our RST, including an iframe for a video! The output can be seen below:

   .. raw:: html

	    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   To embed a different video, find it on YouTube, click "Share", then "Embed", and copy the iframe.
